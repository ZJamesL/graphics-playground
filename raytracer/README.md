Implementation of raytracer from this book https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/
Gabriel Gambetta has the implementation right here https://github.com/ggambetta/computer-graphics-from-scratch/blob/master/demos/raytracer-01.html

# Overview
The chapter on implementing the raytracer provides code for many of the operations, so much so you can implement your own raytracer without having to consult his implemenation. 

# basic_raytracer.js and basic_raytracer.html
raytracer.js and raytracer.html are my attempts at implementing a raytracer just from following the "Basic Raytracing" chapter without consulting the code except for a quick glance to start off.
