# Overview
Implementation of raytracer from this book https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/
Gabriel Gambetta has the implementation right here https://github.com/ggambetta/computer-graphics-from-scratch/blob/master/demos/raytracer-01.html
The chapter on implementing the raytracer provides code for many of the operations, so much so you can implement your own raytracer without having to consult his implemenation. 

# basic_raytracer.js and basic_raytracer_improved.js
basic_raytracer.js is my attempts at implementing a raytracer just from the "Basic Raytracing" chapter without consulting the code except for a quick glance to start off. basic_rayracer_improved.js is the implementation of the raytracer after I have completed the first one and looked over Gabriel Gambetta's implementation and incorporated code from his that I think are better than what I did. Both of these raytracers can be seen in action on the raytrace.html page.
